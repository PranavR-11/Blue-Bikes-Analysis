How do seasonal trends and ridership behaviors differ between casual and registered users across all months, and how can this insight be used to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies?

Here is a suggested README.md for your Blue Bikes Analytics Dashboard project:

Blue Bikes Analytics Dashboard

Overview

This project showcases an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Blue Bikes data to uncover key trends in bike usage, trip durations, and station popularity. The dashboard provides actionable insights for understanding user behavior across customer and subscriber types.

Business Questions Addressed
	1.	Monthly Bike Usage Trends:
	•	How does bike usage vary by user type (Customer vs. Subscriber) over months of the year?
	2.	Trip Duration Analysis:
	•	What are the differences in average trip durations between user types and how do they change monthly?
	3.	Station Popularity:
	•	Which stations are the most popular based on the number of trips initiated?
	4.	Geospatial Analysis:
	•	Where are the most popular bike stations located geographically?

Insights
	1.	Monthly Usage Trends:
	•	Bike usage is consistently higher for Subscribers across all months, with a peak in July and August.
	2.	Trip Duration Patterns:
	•	Casual users have a significantly higher average trip duration (~200 minutes in July), likely driven by tourism and leisure activities during summer months. In contrast, Subscribers have a steady average trip duration across the year (~23–52 minutes).
	3.	Top Stations:
	•	Stations like MIT at Mass Ave/Amherst and Central Square at Mass Ave are among the top locations for bike usage.
	4.	Geographical Hotspots:
	•	High bike usage is concentrated around MIT and key areas in Boston, particularly near Kendall T and South Station.

Dashboard

Dataset
	•	Source: Blue Bikes Open Data
	•	Fields Included: User type, trip start times, trip durations, bike stations, and geographical coordinates.

Methodology
